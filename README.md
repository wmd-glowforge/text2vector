## Advanced Function - Kerning Editing

To use the advanced featured - Kerning Editing - simply make sure you have "Kerning" enabled, and enable "Kerning Editing".

This will allow you to adjust the spacing between certain pairs of characters.  Place your cursor between two characters in the textarea.  Then use the F-keys to adjust the spacing.  "F1" decreased space by 10%. "F2" increases space by 10%. "F3" decreases space by 1%. "F4" increases space by 1%.  "F5" will download the in memory kerning table, so you can replace the default one, or store the values for use later.
